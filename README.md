# MIDI-Tempo-Tuner
This application lets you adjust the tempo of a midi file automatically by providing a reference MIDI file, or manually by passing in the target BPM value. This can be of use should you like to use public domain MIDI files from the Mutopia Project (https://www.mutopiaproject.org/) which happen to have the wrong tempo.

I will be posting my code regularly (almost in real time) in case there is anyone posing as me and wishing to take credit for my work!!!

- Log 1 June 15 2023 19h19: I am wondering whether I should add the functionality of merging MIDIs before performing tempo adjustment relative to another MIDI file. However, what if the two MIDI files I wish to merge together aren't of the same tempo? Problems, problems...
- I'm trying to be a bit more mellow when I program, which means coding at my own pace. It feels more pleasant this way. I also like sharing my thoughts with the "Universe".
