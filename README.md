# MIDI-Tempo-Tuner
This application lets you adjust the tempo of a midi file automatically by providing a reference MIDI file, or manually by passing in the target BPM value. This can be of use should you like to use public domain MIDI files from the Mutopia Project (https://www.mutopiaproject.org/) which happen to have the wrong tempo.

I will be posting my code regularly (almost in real time) in case there is anyone posing as me and wishing to take credit for my work!!!
